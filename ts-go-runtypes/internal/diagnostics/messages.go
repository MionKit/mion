package diagnostics

// messages.go is the single source of the USER-FACING wording for every
// diagnostic code: the single-line Headline (mandatory; `{0}`, `{1}`
// placeholders substitute against Diagnostic.Args) and the optional
// multi-line Detail block (explanation + example fix, surfaced in IDE hover
// and verbose logs). The wire never carries this text — the binary ships
// code + args only; `pnpm run gen:diag-catalog` exports this map into the
// GENERATED front-end dictionary
// (packages/ts-runtypes-devtools/src/go-generated/diagnosticCatalog.generated.ts) that the
// bundler plugin, the lint plugin, and the runtime alwaysThrow factory all
// render from. Every registered code MUST have a Headline
// (TestEveryCodeHasHeadline pins it); an entry for an unregistered code
// panics at init, mirroring prose.go.
//
// Wording standard (same as the docs prose):
//  1. Use the user's TypeScript vocabulary (property names, identifiers,
//     imported helpers) — no compiler internals.
//  2. State the user-visible consequence, not what the compiler did.
//  3. End the Detail with the fix as concrete code where possible.
//  4. Headline first; Detail carries the explanation + example.
